Merry Christmas to all! It's taken me a little longer than I expected to get this blog up and running- well, here's hoping it doesn't crash the moment I publish this, so if you see this, all praise be to the mysterious gods of the interwebs. I'm sure you're wondering what this blog is about. Allow me to explain.

I love history, though I can by no means be considered an expert (or even remotely learned in the discipline for that matter). My "research" mainly consists of a voracious consumption of books, podcasts and articles on the internet. 

Anyway, while holidaying in Nice, I happened upon a busy road named Avenue de Verdun. An image of the Battle of Verdun, in all its bloody horror and the resulting crater-filled landscape, flashed through my mind.

*I should definitely read up on that*, I thought to myself. *Down the rabbit hole we go!* That's when I realised there is a potentially vast wealth of history hidden behind all the street names in the world.

Again, I want to emphasise that I'm no authority on the subject of history. Rather than trying to compile a reference of any kind, I hope this side project will encourage me to go deeper down the rabbit hole, to dig past the superficial details of historic events and people. And who knows, if my ramblings happen to entice you to venture down the rabbit hole with me, then so much the better!

So I hope this is the start of a series of posts about the rich stories that make up our history, as signposted by street names. Next week, a post about the aforementioned Avenue de Verdun in greater detail. Stay tuned.â–ª
